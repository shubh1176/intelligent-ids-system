## Overview

This project aims to enhance the security of networks by detecting potential intrusions using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Key features include:

- **Deep Neural Networks**: Efficient pattern recognition for identifying malicious activities.
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed training without compromising data privacy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust cleaning and preparation of raw data for accurate analysis.
- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive feature analysis to improve detection accuracy.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Visualization tools for live tracking of network activity and anomalies.

## Features(under development)

- **Centralized and Federated Learning**: Supports traditional centralized training and federated learning for distributed environments.
- **Advanced Model Architecture**: Leverages deep neural networks for efficient detection of network anomalies.
- **Comprehensive Dataset Utilization**: Utilizes CICIDS2017 dataset for diverse intrusion scenarios.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Includes dashboards to monitor network traffic and detect intrusions in real time.

## Dataset

This project uses the [CICIDS2017 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html), a widely recognized dataset for network intrusion detection research. 

- **Usage**:
  - The dataset must be downloaded and appropriately preprocessed before use in the IDS.
